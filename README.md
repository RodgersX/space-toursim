# Space Tourism Multipage Website
The project is a frontend mentor project to build a multi-page space tourism website and get it as close to the design as possible

## Ideologies and technologies I've used
The overall framework I've used is VueJS<br>
Used CSS preprocessor scss to write css styling for the layout <br>
Employed vanilla JS to display tab information dynamically<br>
The website has an optimal layout for each page depending on the device screen size<br>
Able to toggle between the tabs to see new information<br>
It contains both hover and active states for the tabs<br>

## Lessons learnt
* Main takeaway from this project was the use of CSS  media queries and breakpoints to properly render responsive web layouts
